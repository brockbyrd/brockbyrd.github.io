I decided to create a message board with sports teams. People like to talk about specific teams with other fans of the teams, so I decided to have a 3 model project with users, teams, and posts. The process of going through the project was fairly smooth at first. I decided to do what I know first and just created the user and post models and connected them. Once those routes and view pages were finished and connected, I decided it was tiime to try to incorporate teams into the mix. This is where it got a little rocky.  I was having trouble adding the team_id attribute to a post, but with a little research and back tracking through the course and figured out the issue. I decided at the tail end of the project build to add CSS and JS through Bootstrap4. Just to give my project a little bit of life and style.
