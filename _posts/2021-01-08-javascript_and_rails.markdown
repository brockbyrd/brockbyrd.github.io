Starting the JavaScript project I was not very confident in my ability to write JavaScript. Once I got started and realized how many tools and "shortcuts" I was missing out on I quickly realized there was a lot more that I could learn about JavaScript even after doing every lesson in the curriculum. The Developer Tools were an absolute life saver when it came to the project. Being able to see the navigation of the code and what gets called when and what is being passed in helped me understand what I was doing a lot more than I have ever before. I also realized that it is okay to ask for help and realize that I don't have to "power through" each error and problem that I have. I looked out onto the internet and watched a good bit of YouTube videos and read A LOT of Medium articles. After stabilizing my mental and taking to third party articles and looking over the curriculum again I started to feel confident. I then started to fly through the project with the help of the Dev Tools. I always seem to learn the most when creating the project. I'm not sure if it is because everything is finally coming together or if it is because I have an actual connection because it is my creation. As of now I can proudly say that I am confident in being a front-end and back-end developer. I can't wait to implement frameworks with JavaScript!
