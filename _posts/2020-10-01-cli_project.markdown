My project allows a user to enter a first or last name of a player in the NBA. The CLI will then output the players with that name in a list. The CLI will then allow the user to pick a player to learn more about. The project was a struggle at first. I was having trouble starting at first. I then used some of the resources to get started and it was off to the races. I did not have much trouble with the writing of the CLI or connecting with the API. But I ended up having trouble with my menuing and looping inside of my CLI. I looked to people inside of my cohort for help and they were nice enough to help me work through my errors and issues. Once those issues were worked through, I didn't seem to have much trouble after that. I then added colorize to give my outputs a little more life for the user to experience.
