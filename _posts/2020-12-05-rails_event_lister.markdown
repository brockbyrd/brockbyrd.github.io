This project made me realize how much I really enjoy coding. The ability to learn something new every single day is not something every field can provide. The ability to constantly expand your "toolset" is something that facinates me. The majority of the week I spent my time googling methods and shortcuts with Devise. Something that was introduced to me by my awesome cohort lead Nancy Noyes. Devise is an absolute game changer. The amount of substance that is provided by Devise is mind boggling. Authentication can be one of the most frustrating things in coding and creating an application, but the step by step set up that Devise provides you takes a HUGE load off. This project really clarified the "magic" that rails provides. The helper methods were fuzzy to me going in, but I now feel more confident in my ability to code than I ever have. Rails is VERY magical but if you understand how to manipulate it and make it do what you want to do...does that make you a wizard??
