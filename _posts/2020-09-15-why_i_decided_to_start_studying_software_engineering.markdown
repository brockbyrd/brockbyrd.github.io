I found out about Software Engineering while I was in college studying Mathematics. A friend of mine at the time was taking a Software Engineering bootcamp, and he was very excited about it and enjoying it a lot. A couple months late I was injured while playing the sport I was in college for and I decided to take a break from school and figure out what I really wanted to do with my life career wise. My friend told me about Udemy and how there are self-paced courses on there. So, I took a web development course and enjoyed it a lot. It offered problem solving and it really challenged me to think about what I was writing and how to go about problem solving. I then started to look through bootcamps and schools with the best curriculums and FlatIron was at the top of a lot of lists. I then asked my friend about a couple and he believed that FlatIron would offer the best curriculum for me, because I had already taken a Web Development course. Taking the step to attend FlatIron and study Software Engineering, I believe, will be one of the best decisions I could ever make.
